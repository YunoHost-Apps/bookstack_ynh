## Configuration

BookStack uses LDAP authentication by default.

You can switch to standard authentication in the webadmin -> bookstack -> config panel setting
For the first time Login with standard authentication, use the default credentials `admin@admin.com` and `password`. You should change these details immediately after logging in for the first time.
